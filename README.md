# 2D_Boids_Meta_Learning
All the simulation data are in ./data/full_data.
Copy paste the data simulation to ./data/train folder for the training dataset. 
Copy paste one simulation to ./data/visual to visualize the prediction across the training given its initial condition.

Run main.py to start training. The defualt is baseline training.
Change line 119 to 'True' to enable meta-learning training.
Change line 121 to 'True' to enable fine-tuning on pre-trained model.
